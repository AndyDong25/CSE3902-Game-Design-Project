	- Currently only supports 1 enemy type with same functionality
		- To have different enemy types, you would need to add more methods and/or if-else branching relating to the enemy's functionality, state and animation
		- Might be better to have an IEnemy interface or Enemy abstract class to implement different types of enemys (traps, stationary NPCS, moving NPCS, projectile NPCS)
	- Probably won't have dynamically changing enemies in final game, so we will not need a ChangeCharacter() method
	- Some fields/objects/methods aren't being used : ninjaStar, isDead, bomb
	- Move enemy random movement to separate function
	- Medium-high coupling

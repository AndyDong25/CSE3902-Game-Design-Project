Comments:

-Style is good, PascalCase and camelCase are followed apropriately and according to conventions There is one case with an
incorrect property, but that property is from a different class, so it should be changed there instead.
-Variable names are also good, although some variable names could be shorter.
(i.e PlayerFacingWestState -> PlayerWestState)
-changeTexture method unimplemented? if the goal is to implement in other classes, maybe add some
comment to notify that that is the case. At least, that is my opinion, otherwise it could be confusing to have a blank method

-I feel like there could be some confusion from using duplicate terminology 
(i.e East, Right, and North, Up are refering to the same thing, but it is confusing at first because they have different implementations).

I also think it's a somewhat confusing design choice to assign states to seperate entire classes, when they could theoretically be represented
as an int instead. Especially when calling the new PlayerFacingXState(), it's unclear as to how that class is being assigned. However, since
this is the way that have done it in class, I guess I cannot harp on it too much.

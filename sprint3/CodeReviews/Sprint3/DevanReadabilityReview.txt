Comments:

	I esstially have the exact same comments for the readability of CollisionDetection.cs, as I do for maintainability of CollisionDetection.cs. The style and flow of the code are all good in terms of readability,
	and nothing feels very confusing or hard to read. The biggest issue is again just the length - which can be solved by refactoring into seperate functions as explained in my maintanability review. Otherwise,
	everything looks good!

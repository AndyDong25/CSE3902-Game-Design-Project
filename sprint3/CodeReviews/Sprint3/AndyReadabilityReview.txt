Comments
	- Biggest issue: nested for-loops makes it difficult to follow
		- Clean up nested loops and/or use helper methods to improve readability
	- High coupling, like the Map1.cs class
	- Looping variables can be more specific (Ex.) Enemy e -> Enemy enemy)
	- Some CollisionHandler classes unused
	- Lots of classes for CollisionHandler (one for each way of collision)

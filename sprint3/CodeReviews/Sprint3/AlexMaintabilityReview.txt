	-Highly easy to maintain.
	-Most of code are raw and very clear, if we need to delete or add more feature, it is very easy and directly edit.
	-We are using as short as possible lines of code to implement the function.
	-All the indents are good to me.
	-But this class has really high coupling, maybe we can make the cohesion higher.

	- We didn't separate the object that "finish-able" or "static (couldn't disappear once set it in the map)". It would take two forloops for checking if something would be diappeared.
	I am thinkng if it would be better for us to catogorize them.
	- For now we are using a map_index to changing map, but it would be better to store the map info in a other data type such as Dir or creating a class for determining what the map
	should look like if we hope to have more complex map system later.
	- Map1 class knows all the players, enemies, items class, which seems to be a high coupling, we separate it by implementing two classes: MapLoader + MapUpdating and have just initialing
	object in one and updating them in another. Also, we can higher abstract some objects and keep only such as ISprite, INPC, Items three types, which could reduce the number of foreach loop.

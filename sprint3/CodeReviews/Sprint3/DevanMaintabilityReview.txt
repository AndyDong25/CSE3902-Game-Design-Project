Overall:

For the content and expectation of this file, the code quality is good, and I belive it meets the requirements for this class in terms of
of the desired functionality. However, in terms of maintanability, there are some potential refactoring strategies that
could make the code a little bit easier to maintain, since it is a bit spread out right now. Specifically, I think it could be a good idea to seperate out all of our for loops into a single
call that can be repeatedly be called for all of for loops, which would make things much more maintanable, since adding new collisions can just be a single call to that function, instead of 
a for loop with lots of lines of code.


Comments:
	
	-Again, capitalization is good, style correctly uses Camelcase and PascalCase as specified.
	-As mentioned in the above section, code redundancy and total length of the file code hurts maintanability, but it can be corrected, or can be left as is.
	I say this because I have seen code bases that have awful maintanability, but are used professionally (i.e, OpenCV, Tensorflow)

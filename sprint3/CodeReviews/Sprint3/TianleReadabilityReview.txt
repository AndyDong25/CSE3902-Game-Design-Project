Comment 
	- We create lots of objects and lists in this class, and used many foreach look to check through every object we hope to update in the map which is a bit messy I think.
	Probably we can use some helper functions for the foreach part.
	- It would be better if we can also put some calculation of bomb explodsion and ninjastar speed into another class or helper functions.
	- The object "finish" process is a bit confusing sometime when reading.
	- Delete some unnecessary code and add some comments on it.

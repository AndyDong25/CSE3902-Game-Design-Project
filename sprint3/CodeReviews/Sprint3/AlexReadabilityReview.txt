Comments
	-highly readable
	-We use the class to initialize the whole map, at first it is short and very clearly to read. 
	-But after our update, more variables and lists were declared, it is slightly not friendly to readers.
	-We should create a void method like LoadLists() to make the class shorter, or AddObjects in the same class, so that it is more readable and maintanable. 
	-Most of commented out code were writeen by me, I think in the future it will be useful and necessary for the class. 
	-Overall, I think we can have some comment, plaintext do help the reader understand why we are doing this and that.

Comments
	- There is a unnecessary getter for variable Game
	- It has a very solid quality of maintability on drawing 
	- in the DrawExplosions, there is no needed comment out code existes, it is implementing same thing, but maybe left there for testing purpose.
	- There is TakeDamage waiting for implement in the future
	- Overall, Except the unneeded commeted out code, the maintability is very high
	- We can easily add variables, change the stucture, modify the whole class with very little change.

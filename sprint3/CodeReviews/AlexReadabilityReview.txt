Comments
	-Medium_high readable
	-We commented out too much things that makes the code slightly difficult to read
	-But most of the commented out code are useful in the future, like: Time, Ispusle, GameState, 
	-If we'll have more code in here, we will create a void method to add these things. But so far not really affecting the readability.

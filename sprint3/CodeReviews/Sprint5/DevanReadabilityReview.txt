Comments:

As there are not many lines of code, there is not much I can comment on. The variables are named apropriately
with respect to their functionality and follow the proper conventions, so in terms of readability I think it is
well done. As in the previous file, I think some variables could be refactored by grouping them into their respective
classes (Isprite), which would help improve cohesion and coupling, and therefore readablility, of the code.

Comments:

The readability is good for the most part, but from personal experience, I think it suffers a bit from low cohesion. This
is due to two factors, variable names, and functionality. While variable names are named apropriately and follow
conventions, they are misleading in what they do. For example, the "Position" variable is named apropriately, but it does not
actually give the position, and instead gives an inverted representation. While this is fine from a implementation standpoint,
it hurts cohesion because the variable is marked public, meaning that it can be assessed by other classes, when it should not be as it does not represent position.
I also think some of the functions could improve cohesion by becomming more high level in what they do. For example, Move and Zoom could be merged into a singular function, in addition to being seperate, since we are always
calling zoom when we are calling move. That being said, I think the functions that exist right now are actually good
and are ok in term's of readability, so I am just suggesting further improvements.

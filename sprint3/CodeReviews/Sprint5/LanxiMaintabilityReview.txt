Comments
	- Inconsistent blank lines
	- Unused variables (like backColor)
	- A loop in initialize() for reading and load files. Maybe we can try to create a helper method for that part
	- Lots of commented code
	- Mediem coupling
		- Directly manipulate data in other modules, resulting in high interdependence between modules 
		- Most of the variables are public, which also means that high dependencies between different modules

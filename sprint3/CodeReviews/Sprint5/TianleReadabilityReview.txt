Comments
	- The logic of this class is clear, but using too many foreach loops which makes the readability become worse
	- Better to use some helper functions for some foreach loops or multi ifs parts, this could make the code more readable.
	- We could consider creating an interface such as CollisionChecker, and some checker implements it do the collision checking job. In this way, we don't need to 
	call a lot of CheckCollison functions in this class, we just need to create a list of the collision checker and call the check function in it. (Similar as how we
	implement a Command design patter)
	- Lack of comments and other documentation for this class
	- We used many variable names like "p1, p2, b, o" in this class which is unclear sometime and hard to distinguish different variables. In real practice, I notice 
	that we confused things like p1 and p2 for several times, so I think it would be better if we can make the variable name longer and more distinguishable such as
	firstPlayer, secondPlayer.
	- It would be much better if all the collisonHandler can have the same format, but this depends on how each collisionHandler be implemented so we can't do much thing
	here in this class for this problem.

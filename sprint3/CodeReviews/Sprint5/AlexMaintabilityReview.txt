Comments
- Highly maintainable
- I would recommend leave more comment to explain what are these lines doing
- Or add a "=======" shape divider to help developer can find the current function easier.
- This class has relation with DecorationTextureStorage.cs, which makes it more maintainable
- If the decoration need to change go to that classs, if the position needs to change go to this class
- That make the job much more easier.

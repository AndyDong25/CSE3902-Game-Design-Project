Comments
	- Helper methods are nice to improve readability of Update() function
	- Remove commented out code for better readability
	- High cyclomatic complexity to loop and compare between two different object "types"
		- Can decrease by further grouping similar objects into another interface like "StaticObject" or "DynamicObject"
	- Some helper methods are still long

Comments:

File looks good, for the most part maintanability is done well. In terms of maintanability, this file
is well integrated into the codebase and should be very easy to maintain. The only comment I will make is that
I think a lot of class memebers could be grouped together using the interfaces that were designed to group those
classes together. For example, I think that the Texture2D and Retangles could be grouped into Isprites, but I'm not
entirely sure. Other than that, this file is nicely done.

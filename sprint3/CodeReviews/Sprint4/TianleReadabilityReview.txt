Comments
	- I think this class is one of the cleanest and organized classes in our project. 
	- It would be better if there's more comments on the code.

	- float rotation can initialize as a field (or a property if we hope to make it public) instead or initialize in the Draw().
	- int radius should be a property with get and set, and can pass the value to radius outside the explode method
	- probably upper letter or another name for the private player to distinguish the player from game.

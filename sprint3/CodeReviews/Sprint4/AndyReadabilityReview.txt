Comments
	- Put initializing and reference setup in class constructor
	- Update() method unclear with item activation
		- Ex.) if (activated) { Activate(gameRef.player1); }
	- "timer" field is uninitialized
	- Some methods are empty, but will probably be filled later as more functionality is implemented
	- Some inconsistent line spacing

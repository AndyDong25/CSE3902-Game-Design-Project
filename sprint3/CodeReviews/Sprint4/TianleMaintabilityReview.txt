	- I think this class has a very clean structure and also a good the maintainability overall.
	- Just like the review for the readability of this class, adding a helper function for the audio processing step may also help this class has better maintainability.
	As every we want to add a new audio, we only need to call the helper function instead of re-code the several steps.
	- If in the future we have much more soundeffects, one way to make this class more maintainable I can think of is to use the similar as what we did for the spritesheets.
	We can build another class that store and load the audios, and the manager just take charge with the audio processing. But for now I think this class is really nice!

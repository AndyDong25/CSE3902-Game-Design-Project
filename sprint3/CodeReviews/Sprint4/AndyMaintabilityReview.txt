	- Can encapsulate GameState in another class and add a GameState field to Game (Decorator Design Pattern)
	- Some fields can be made private and passed to other class constructors
	- Initialize() can use helper method or class to encapsulate map loading
	- Looks good in general though: small and concise methods, high cohesion and low coupling
